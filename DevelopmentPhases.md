# Building and Running #

## Building the Project ##
The distribution is built by running "build.gradle" in BrailleUtils with Gradle. "build.gradle" in each project can also generate Javadoc and run unit tests.

**Note! This project has recently been updated to use Gradle instead of Ant and some features of the old build are not yet available.**

## Committing code ##
If applicable, add unit tests to verify your changes and make sure that all unit tests pass before committing code to the project. Also, remember to enter a descriptive commit comment, describing the key aspects of your work.
