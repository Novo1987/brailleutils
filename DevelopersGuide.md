# Introduction #
The goal of this project is
to provide core functionality needed to interact with PEF-files,
to provide implementations for commonly used software/hardware related to PEF-files and
to provide an easy way for others to extend the list of implementations.

# Main Features #
The project contains code to:
  * Emboss a PEF-file
  * Validate a PEF-file
  * Collect meta data about a PEF-file
  * Convert from text to a PEF-file
  * Convert from a PEF-file to text
  * Implement embossers, tables and papers

Soon the following features will be included too:
  * Split a PEF-file into one file/volume
  * Merge several PEF-files into one
