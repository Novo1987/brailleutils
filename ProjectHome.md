# Braille Utils #
_Communicating with embossers has never been easier!_

## Summary ##
BrailleUtils provides a cross platform API for embossing and converting braille in PEF-format.

Conversion to and from commonly used "braille" text formats is also supported.

The package is written in Java and contains basic user interfaces for common operations. However, the main purpose of the package is as part of other software, such as the Daisy Pipeline and odt2braille.

## Main Features ##
  * Emboss PEF-files
  * Validate PEF-files
  * Convert to/from PEF
  * Split/merge PEF-files

## Supported Embossers ##
The package currently supports a majority of available embossers, including popular [Index](http://www.indexbraille.com/) and [Braillo](http://www.braillo.com/) embossers. For details, see the complete list of [supported embossers](SupportedEmbossers.md). Note that some embossers are untested, because they are unavailable to us.

## About PEF ##
[PEF](http://pef-format.org) is an emerging file format for representing braille books accurately and unambiguously in digital form. Using PEF ensures that the contents of the file is embossed correctly. _No braille knowledge is ever required from the operator_.

PEF has been been awarded with the [Braille21 Award](http://www.braille21.net/en/programme).
