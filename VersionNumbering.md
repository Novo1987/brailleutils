# Version Numbering #
Version numbers must be updated whenever changes to the code are published or deployed (updated in other projects).

## When to change the major segment ##
The major segment should change when the API changes substantially or when the implementation is incompatible with previous version.

## When to change the minor segment ##
The minor segment should change when additional features have been added, such as a new language or new or replaced hyphenation tables.

## When to change the service segment ##
The service segment should change when bugs are fixed (other than the ones listed above), or if translation tables or hyphenation patterns are updated.
